# maze-generator

Generate mazes with JavaScript and HTML Canvas. This program makes perfect mazes using the [recursive backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search) algorithm, and then draws the solution.

Compile with `tsc`, then run with `python -m http.server`.
